Fortune Teller

About:
This application will first ask your name, then allow you to pick from a range of options. Currently implemented are the Fortune, Joke, and name change options (as well as an exit option). The Fortune and Joke options both connect to separate public APIs to retrieve their response. In the case of the fortune API, the response is parsed from JSON and extra data is omitted. The joke API returns programming-oriented jokes. You can save and load jokes, fortunes, and names to\from a text file. The text files can be deleted as well. Jokes and fortunes are organized in the text file by the current date and time. For names, a list of all names entered in the current session can be displayed independently of names in the text file.

Current Project Requirement Features Included:
-Master Loop
-Read from External API and display that data in the app
-Read data from external file
