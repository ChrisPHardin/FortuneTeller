Fortune Teller WIP

About:
This application will first ask your name, then allow you to pick from a range of options. Currently implemented are the Fortune, Joke, and name change options (as well as an exit option). The Fortune and Joke options both connect to separate public APIs to retrieve their response. In the case of the fortune API, the response is parsed from JSON and extra data is omitted, but it does not always display perfectly (in its current state). The joke API seems to consistently return well-formatted, programming-oriented jokes.

Current Project Requirement Features Included:
-Master Loop
-Read from External API and display that data in the app
-Saving/loading from file
